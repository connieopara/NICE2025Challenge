## Preventative Protection: Thwarting the Imminent Threat [NG]

Based on research, EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. The vulnerability exists because the SMB version 1 (SMBv1) server in various versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute code on the target computer remotely.

To mitigate the risk of EternalBlue attack I needed to patch the Domain Controller.

I logged into the Domain-Controller VM. Next, I opened Control Panel > System and Security and checked for updates. I downloaded and Installed the update. One update failed. Patching did not resolve the attack.

The next option was to disable the SMB1 protocol. 

Next, I opened Powershell as an administrator and entered the following commands to disable SMB1 on the Domain Controller. 

Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false -Force

to confirm that it had been disabled, I used the following command:

Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB1Protocol

I restarted the Domain Controller and had to wait until the "Attack Thwarted" check mark changed to Green to indicate that the attack had been prevented.

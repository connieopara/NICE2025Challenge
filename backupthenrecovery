# # A Database Story: Backup then Recovery 
First I logged into the Database VM and opened the command prompt as Administrator.

In the Administrator command prompt, type MySQL 

This will take you into the MySQL environmentfrom MySQL prompt type SHOW DATABASES;

mysql > SHOW DATABASES;

This will display all the databases on the server, including wordpress.

To check the MYSQL version type:

mysql > SELECT VERSION(); 

This returned the version information

Version 5.7.21

1 row in set <0.0.0 sec>

Exit Mysql by typing Exit or Quit then press Enter to return to the normal command prompt.

Next step: back up the WordPress database using the mysqldump command in the command prompt (not inside MySQL prompt)

To back up the database, I needed to First, find where MySQL was installed i.e. the binary path of MySQL database in the Windows server. On the command prompt, type  where mysql

Alternatively, you could search for mysql.exe by clicking on the search bar.

It was located at C:\ProgramData\Scoop\apps\mysql\bin\mysq.exe 

To change directory to the MySQL bin folder, Type

C:\ cd ProgramData\Scoop\apps\mysql\5.7.21\bin

this will take you to: C:\ProgramData\Scoop\apps\mysql\5.7.21\bin> prompt

Next, Create a MySQL Dump of the 'wordpress' Database

sudo mysqldump -u root -p wordpress > C:\dump.sql

This creates a dump.sql file at C:\dump.sql.When prompted, enter the MySQL root password.

Next, transfer the Backup File (dump.sql) to the Backup Server at 172.16.30.79

First I tested connectivity between the Database and Backup servers ping 172.16.30.79 then from the command prompt initiate a file transfer using:

C:\> scp dump.sql root@172.16.30.79:/ftp/public/backup This returned an error because /ftp/public/backup did not exist at the backup server so I logged into Backup to rectify this. 

Log into Backup VM, type ls

then create ftp/public/prodbackup type:

sudo mkdir ftp/public/prodbackup

Back on the Database server transfer the dump.sql file type:

C:\> scp dump.sql root@172.16.30.79:/ftp/public/backup this was successful. 

Now, verify that the transfer was successful on the backup server. Type ls -l dump.sql should exist

To log in to the MySQL database on the Backup server using the mysql command type:

sudo mysql -u root -p and enter password when prompted.

You should see something like Welcome to the MariaDB Monitor . Server version 10.1.48-MariaDB .....

Next, I created a database to import the dump into, I used "wordpresstest" using the command:

CREATE DATABASE wordpresstest;

you should see something like Query OK, 1 Row affected (0.00sec)

Verify the database was created by typing:

SHOW DATABASES; 

then exit Mysql.

I used the dump.sql to restore the database in the backup server:

import the dump.sql file into the MySQL database (wordpresstest) using the following command:

I moved into the root by typing sudo -i

in root type:

 mysql -u root -p wordpresstest < /ftp/public/prodbackup/dump.sql

You will be prompted for the password.

The dump.sql file was imported from the location /ftp/public/prodbackup/dump.sql.

Finally, to verify that the data had been successfully imported. I logged into MySQL again and checked the database using the following commands:

mysql -u root -p

USE my_database;

SHOW TABLES;

Everything displayed correctly.

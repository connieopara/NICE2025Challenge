# # Forensically Finding Files

First, I logged into the Workstation desk and opened File Explorer to search for files with modified dates after February 2020. I did not find any files.

Next, I went to disk management and noticed three file partitions. One of the volumes FlashDrive did not have a drive letter. Using the change drive letter wizard, I named it Drive E.

In File Explorer, with hidden files and file extensions enabled under the views tab, I reviewed the contents of the E Drive (FlashDrive) and found two files that had been modified after February 2020.

JanPayChecks.txt and Instructions.pdf

Next, transfer these files to the Security Desk without modifying them:

I used the following commands in the command prompt

# This command switches from the current directory to the E: drive and takes you to its root directory (E:\).

>cd /d E:\ 

>ls

> cd Finances

I used the ls command to view the contents of the E:\ and cd Finances to change to the Finances folder

The following command was used to transfer the file to the Security-Desk Desktop. 

> scp JanPayChecks.txt playerone@172.16.30.6:/home/playerone/Desktop/Evidence

when prompted for the password, I entered Playerone credentials (password123) and chose Yes when prompted 

I transferred the second file using the same method.

>cd /d E:\
E:\> scp Instrcutions.pdf playerone@172.16.30.6:/home/playerone/Desktop/Evidence
#enter password

The files were successfully transferred to the Security Desk.

I logged into the Security Desk to confirm if the files were now on the Desktop and sure enough, they were,

Next, I created an archive of the two files using the Archive wizard, I selected both files and right-clicked on them, and selected Archive. then changed the file extension to .tar and named the file 'forarchive' as instructed. 

Finally, I used the 'pdfid' utility to scan Instructions.pdf saved the scan result  to a document called pdfresults.txt, and moved it to the desktop using the following command:

pdfid filename.pdf > pdfresults.txt where filename was Instructions.pdf

> pdfid Instructions.pdf > ~/Desktop/pdfresults.txt

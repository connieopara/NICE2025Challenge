## Helpdesk Fun: User Workstation Nightmares [NG]

Helpdesk Report: Resolving User Workstation Issues

The following steps were taken to address and resolve issues on the user's workstation:

1. Correcting Mouse Button Configuration

Upon logging into the WorkstationDesk VM, it was observed that the mouse buttons were reversed. To rectify this:

 Accessed Settings via the Start menu.

 Navigated to Devices > Mouse.

 I changed the primary button settings from right to left.

Explanation: This adjustment ensures the left mouse button functions as the primary selection button, aligning with standard user preferences.

2. Displaying Desktop Icons

The desktop was missing its icons. To display them:

 Right-clicked on the desktop and selected View.

 Enabled the Show Desktop icons option.

Explanation: Enabling this option restores the visibility of all desktop shortcuts and files.

3. Mapping the HR Network Share to Drive H:

To provide the user with access to the HR department's shared resources:

 Opened File Explorer.

 Navigated to Network and selected FILESHARE.

 Right-clicked on the hr folder and chose Map network drive.

 Assigned drive letter H:

 Checked "Reconnect at signin" and ensured "Connect using different credentials" was unchecked.

 Clicked Finish to complete the mapping.

Explanation: Mapping the HR shared folder to drive H allows quick and consistent access to departmental resources.

4. Resolving Internet Connectivity Issues

The user reported an inability to access the internet. The following steps were undertaken:

 Verified Network Connection:

 Used the Ping utility to test connectivity to the ISP gateway 172.31.2.1, and received replies.

  Attempted to access a website via a browser; received a "Can't connect to proxy server" error.

 Checked Proxy Settings:

Opened Settings, Network & Internet, Proxy

 In the settings, I turned off the Use a proxy server option.

After disabling the proxy server setting, internet connectivity was restored.

Explanation: Incorrect proxy settings can redirect internet traffic improperly, leading to connectivity issues. Disabling unnecessary proxy settings often resolves these problems.

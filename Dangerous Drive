After identifying the infected files, I opened File Explorer and located the E: drive. Before searching for the files, I enabled the "hidden items" and "file name extensions" options under View. I located the four infected files and permanently deleted the four infected files using shift + Delete.

After deleting the four infected files I performed another scan on the E drive using ClamWin and the results showed no infected file.

##Linux Administration 101: Users, Access & Updates  

1) Creating a User Account for Gary Thatcher 
I booted up the Prod-Web server Virtual Machine and logged in. To create a user account for Gary Thatcher with the username gthatcher, I executed the following command:  

sudo adduser gthatcher


2) Granting Admin (Sudo) Privileges  
To give gthatcher administrative privileges, I used the visudo tool to safely edit the sudoers file. I opened it by running:

sudo visudo
 
Once inside the file, I scrolled to the bottom and typed in the letter i to enter insert mode then added the following line:  

gthatcher ALL=(ALL) ALL
```  
To save and exit, I pressed <Esc>, then typed:  

:wq
  

3) Updating the Apache Web Server  
Finally, I updated the Apache web server using the following command:  

sudo yum update


This completed the lab requirement.

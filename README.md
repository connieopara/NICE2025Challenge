#### NICE2025Challenge
February 6, 2025
My step-by-step work process for solving the NICE XP Range cybersecurity challenge
I decided to document the steps I took because when I started this challenge, I had no idea how to go about it until I came across the DoubtfulFox Github account and his documented processes provided useful guidance. 
The steps below are based on my experience when completing the Challenge in Spring 2025. I hope it also becomes useful to you.

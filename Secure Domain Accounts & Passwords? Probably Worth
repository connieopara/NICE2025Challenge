#Secure Domain Accounts & Passwords? Probably Worth [NG]

First, I launched the Workstation-Desk VM and logged in. I double-clicked on the DASWebs Share folder and navigated to Network > Fileshare > dasShare.

I accessed the "Dynamic Arbitrary Solutions Policy" PDF to review the necessary policies.

Next, I launched the Domain-Controller VM and logged in. Once on the Domain-Controller, I launched Server Manager and proceeded to Group Policy Management.

Within Group Policy Management, I expanded the directory structure under Forest > daswebs.com > Group Policy Object.

Under this section, I created a new GPO named "DasPol." After creating the GPO, I right-clicked on it and selected the "Edit" option.

Next, I navigated through "Computer Configuration" > "Policies" > "Windows Settings" > "Security Settings" > "Account Policies."

Then modified the Password Policy and Account Lockout Policies according to the guidelines outlined in the "Dynamic Arbitrary Solutions Policy" PDF as follows:

Account Lockout Duration - 15 Minutes
Account Lockout Threshold - 3 invalid attempts
Reset Account Lockout Counter - 15 Minutes

Maximum Password Age - 60 Days
Minimum Password Age - 30 Days
Minimum Password Length - 12 Characters
Password History - 24 Passwords Remembered
Password must Meet Complexity Requirements - Enabled
Store Passwords Using Reversible Encryption - Disabled

To apply the newly created GPO at the domain level, I right-clicked on the "daswebs.com" domain and selected "Link an Existing GPO..."

then selected "DasPol" from the list, clicked "Ok" and initiated the process by clicking "Detect Now."

This procedure ensured that the required security policies were correctly implemented within the domain environment.

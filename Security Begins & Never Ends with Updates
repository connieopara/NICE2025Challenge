Security Begins & Never Ends with Updates [NG]

Vulnerable FTP Updated:

First, I logged on to the Backup server and updated the FTP service by using the command:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Guest Admin Privileges Disabled

Next, I logged onto the Domain Controller. I launched Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers > daswebs.com > Users.
I right-clicked on user Guest and selected properties. I clicked on the Member Of tab and selected Domain Admin. 
Next, I clicked on the Remove button to remove the guest user from the Domain Admin group. Click apply > OK > Ok

Joomla Updated

Finally, I logged onto the Workstation-Desk VM and opened the Firefox browser.
In the address bar, I entered "joomla.daswebs.com/administrator".
I signed in using the Playerone credentials for accessing Joomla.
There was a newer version available, I updated Joomla and completed the lab.
